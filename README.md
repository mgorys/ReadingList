## Architecture

This is a web application, which uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) design patter.

Model part is supported by repository-service pattern, which contains businness logic with operations that should be performed by it.

Repository-Service pattern divides the business layer into two semi-layers. Repository handles getting data into and out of database.

Service is responsible for operations on data and passing them between repository and controller.

## Client
